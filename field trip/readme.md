## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

A website that features sculptures from different native cultures. This is inspired by the different sculptures at the Eiteljorg museum like Face to Face and Bear Dancer. Artist would be able to sign up and submit images and information about their sculpture.

### Core Webpages

For regular users:

- Front page where people can explore and get interested in the sculptures and cultures.
- Catalog page where sculptures are listed and people can filter and search for something specific. They would be able to search for a specific material, artist, or culture.
- Individual pages for the sculptures with information about that sculpture.
- individual page for artist.
- individual pages for cultures.
- Videos about sculptures and cultures, digital puzzles of sculptures that give more information once solved, game like quizzes.

For Artists:

- Login page for artist to sign in.
- Profile page where artist can add, edit, update, and delete content.
- A section where artist can search and filter though uploaded sculptures.

### Design Choices

I would use muted or earthy colors, maybe some type of orange and brown with blue, for a color palette. Some ideas like the digital puzzle comes from visiting the museum, they had physical puzzles of paintings that were displayed.
