## Assignment 1: Full-Stack Development Recap

---

### Full-Stack Web Development

Full-stack web development refers to both front end and back end web development.

- Front end development is focused on user interface and experience.
- Back end development is focused on managing the server, database and application logic.

### Node.js Understanding

Node.js allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side which enables them to use a single programming language for both front end and back end development. Node.js is efficient, lightweight, and well-suited for building scalable, real-time applications.

| Key features of Node.js     |                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Non-blocking I/O:           | Handles multiple requests efficiently without waiting for any single request to complete. |
| Event-driven architecture:  | Responds to user actions, making it ideal for real-time applications.                     |
| NPM (Node Package Manager): | Provides access to thousands of libraries to extend functionality.                        |
